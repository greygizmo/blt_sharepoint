Objective:
Create a single-page intranet (SharePoint) landing page using Next.js, Shadcn UI components, and Framer Motion animations. This page serves as the main information hub for employees about a new product partnership with BLT. The design must exude a bold retro-futurism vibe, featuring a light mode, mostly grayscale color scheme with accents of BLT’s orange (#EA5504), and a subtle laser-like glow effect animated throughout the scroll. The website should be minimalistic, stylish, visually stunning, stable, and easy to edit with plug-and-play functionality for images and data.
Overall Design Requirements
Framework: Use Next.js for the structure, Shadcn UI for components, and Framer Motion for animations.

Color Scheme: 
Light mode background (e.g., #F5F5F5 or white).

Grayscale typography and elements (e.g., #333, #666, #999).

Accents of BLT’s orange (#EA5504) for highlights, buttons, and interactive elements.

Retro-Futurism Vibe: 
Use clean, geometric shapes (e.g., circles, sharp lines).

Add subtle gradients (e.g., grayscale with orange hints).

Incorporate a laser-like glow effect (orange glow on borders, titles, or as a scroll indicator).

Animations: 
Use Framer Motion for smooth scroll-based transitions, fade-ins, and glow effects.

Animate a vertical "laser line" (orange, #EA5504) that follows scroll progress with a subtle glow.

Layout: 
Single-page design with smooth scrolling between sections: WHO, WHAT, WHY, HOW, and CLOSING NOTE.

Include anchor navigation links at the top.

Responsiveness: Fully responsive for desktop and mobile.

Stability & Editability: 
Optimize for performance (e.g., lazy loading for images).

Use props or a simple CMS structure for easy content updates.

Separate components clearly (e.g., WhoSection.jsx, WhatSection.jsx).

Section 1: WHO IS BLT?
Description: Introduces BLT with Mission, Vision, Core Values, and a Timeline of Milestones.
Components:
Accordion for Mission, Vision, Core Values:
Use <Accordion> from Shadcn UI.

Each item (e.g., "Mission") has a title and expandable content.

Style headers with #EA5504 and a subtle glow effect on hover (Framer Motion).

Example content: "Mission: To innovate 3D printing solutions."

Interactive Horizontal Timeline:
Place at the end of the WHO section.

Create a custom component with clickable dots or cards for milestones (e.g., "2011: Company Established").

On click, expand to show details (e.g., description, date).

Style with a grayscale track and orange dots/cards; animate active milestone with a glow effect.

Layout:
Accordion at the top, full-width.

Timeline below, horizontally scrollable with a fixed height (e.g., 200px).

Animations:
Fade-in accordion items as they enter the viewport.

Animate the timeline’s glow effect along the track as the user scrolls.

Section 2: WHAT
Description: Highlights BLT’s offerings with Product & Services, Unique Selling Points (USP), Key Industries Served, and Offerings subsections.
Components:
Product & Services Subsections (e.g., "BLT Metal 3D Printers"):
Each subsection is a distinct component, scrolled vertically.

Layout:
Left: Image (placeholder, 50% width).

Right: Title (e.g., "BLT Metal 3D Printers") in #EA5504 and description in grayscale.

Use clean typography and minimal padding.

Carousel for BLT Printers (below "BLT Metal 3D Printers"):
Use <Carousel> from Shadcn UI or a custom solution.

Each card includes:
Printer Name (e.g., "BLT-S600")

Image (square, placeholder)

Build Volume (e.g., "600 x 600 x 600 mm")

Build Rate (e.g., "100 cm³/h")

Lasers/Power (e.g., "4 x 500W")

Applications (e.g., "Aerospace, Medical")

Button: "Download Datasheet" (links to OneDrive PDF)

Style cards with grayscale backgrounds, #EA5504 borders, and a glow hover effect.

Unique Selling Points (USP):
Use <Tabs> from Shadcn UI.

Each tab (e.g., "High-Speed Multi-Laser Printing") shows corresponding details.

Active tab indicator in #EA5504 with a glow effect.

Key Industries Served:
Use a carousel with square image cards.

Each card:
Image (grayscale filter, square).

Title over image (e.g., "Aerospace") in #EA5504.

Description appears on hover (grayscale text, orange border).

Offerings:
Identical to Product & Services: image on left, title and description on right.

Layout:
Vertically stacked subsections with clear separation (e.g., padding or subtle dividers).

Carousel sections span full width.

Animations:
Fade-in subsections as they enter the viewport.

Animate carousel cards sliding in with a glow effect on hover.

Section 3: WHY
Description: Explains why choose BLT with Value Proposition for Customers and Competitive Differentiators.
Components:
Sectioned Scroll with Persistent Titles:
Left Side: Fixed-position titles ("WHY" and subsection, e.g., "Value Proposition for Customers") in #EA5504 with a glow effect.

Right Side: Scrollable <div> listing items (e.g., value propositions).

When the user scrolls to the end of the list, the page scrolls to "Competitive Differentiators," updating the right-side content.

Example value proposition: "Cost-effective 3D printing solutions."

Layout:
Left: 30% width, fixed titles.

Right: 70% width, scrollable content area.

Animations:
Fade-in titles and content as the section enters the viewport.

Animate the scroll transition between subsections with a smooth glow effect.

Section 4: HOW
Description: Provides contact information.
Components:
Contact Cards:
Use <Card> from Shadcn UI.

Each card includes:
Name (e.g., "Josh Brown")

Role (e.g., "Sales Leader")

Contact (e.g., "jbrown@goengineer.com")

Style with grayscale backgrounds, #EA5504 borders, and a glow hover effect.

Layout:
Grid or row layout (e.g., 3 cards per row on desktop).

Animations:
Scale up cards slightly on hover with a glow effect.

Section 5: CLOSING NOTE
Description: Concludes with a call to action.
Components:
Text Block: Centered closing text in grayscale.

Call to Action:
Two buttons:
"Sales Playbook" (placeholder link)

"Technical Playbooks" (placeholder link)

Style with #EA5504 backgrounds and a glowing hover effect.

Layout:
Centered text and buttons with ample white space.

Animations:
Fade-in text and buttons with a pulsing glow on the buttons.

Additional Instructions
Laser-Like Glow Effect:
Implement an orange (#EA5504) glow on section borders, titles, or as a vertical scroll indicator.

Use Framer Motion to animate the glow moving with scroll progress (e.g., motion.div with scrollYProgress).

Plug-and-Play:
Use props for all text and images (e.g., {title}, {imageSrc}).

Include placeholder images (e.g., gray squares) and text where needed.

Performance:
Lazy load images and components outside the initial viewport (next/image with loading="lazy").

Optimize animations for smooth scrolling.

Editability:
Organize code into separate components (e.g., WhoSection.jsx, WhatSection.jsx).

Use CSS modules or styled-components for modular styling.

Final Notes
Retro-Futurism: Emphasize clean lines, geometric shapes, and bold orange accents to evoke a futuristic yet nostalgic feel.

Minimalism: Maintain ample white space, avoiding clutter, while ensuring visual impact with animations and glows.

Bold UI: Trust this structure for a stunning, user-friendly experience from the start.
